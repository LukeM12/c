    /*
 Client Side
-Create a socket with the socket() system call
-Connect the socket to the address of the server using the connect() system call
-Send and receive data. There are a number of ways to do this, but the simplest is to use the read() and write() system calls.
-The steps involved in establishing a socket on the server side are as follows:





Server side
-Create a socket with the socket() system call
-Bind the socket to an address using the bind() system call. For a server socket on the Internet, an address consists of a port number on the host machine.
-Listen for connections with the listen() system call
-Accept a connection with the accept() system call. This call typically blocks until a client connects with the server.

Send and receive data


Here is an excerb from the man page of socket listen function
           1.  A socket is created with socket(2).

           2.  The  socket  is  bound  to  a local address using bind(2), so that
               other sockets may be connect(2)ed to it.

           3.  A willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue limit for
               incoming connections are specified with listen().

           4.  Connections are accepted with accept(2).

    //But this is how the Queue should be called for this project
    //Note for testing, the point is to make a structure and add it to the
    //Queue, which paramters are filled out
    //Then
    //1)Pass the data flawlessly to the queue
    //2)Add more queue-like operatings, enqueue, deletequeue
    //3)Test Queueue operations
    //4)Set up sockets for data transfer
    //5)Start trading information test cases
    //6)Migrate that to python binding the C and python libraries
    //7)Make GUI in python
    //Starting with 2 queues, one for client and one for server
